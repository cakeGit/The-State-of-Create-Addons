# (Curseforge) The state of create mods

## 25% of downloads are attributed to just 5 mods

![Downloads by mod](./images/downloads_by_mod_pie.png)

The 3 mods are: Crafts and additions, Steam and rails, Slice 'n' Dice. The other two are compat mods: Create Kube.JS, and Iris & Oculus support.

Here is a clearer list of a top section of mods:

## 25% of downloads are attributed to just 3 authors

The big 3: MRHminer (1 mod), possible_triangle (2 mods), IThundxr (3 mods).

Top ~50 authors (total download count):

I'm 44th :)

## DragonsPlus is the number one modder by download performance!

Here is now the authors, but associated with their rates of download rather than accumulated downloads:

Here again you can see there is actually quite a large gap between DragonsPlus and the next highest modder (IThundxr)

## Mods by download rates

![Download rate by mod](./images/download_rate_by_mod.png)

Quite similar to the mods by total download counts, but it is a bit more even, also clearly shows Steam 'n' Rails and Crafts and Additions to be the 2 main downloaded mods.

## Mods by download performance against their actual download counts

![Download rate by author](./images/download_rate_against_downloads.png)

While there are many breakthroughs, few of the highest performing mods are new, which is to be expected since as the way I see it, the 'promotion loop' forms a significant portion of downloads for these mods (where more downloaded mods show up higher in listings and are in turn downloaded more), rather than just the contributions from modpack inclusions.

## Conclusions

I'm going to lock in and produce the coolest mod ever just you wait im going to be NUMBER ONE.  

## Biases

Because all of this data is sourced from Curseforge there are some important biases to note:

- Mods that are included in modpacks are significantly more downloaded
- More technical mods (such as my own, pattern schematics) perform worse than more general mods (like trading floor) on modrinth rather than curseforge
- Some mods might be missing, of the massive sample I was able to collect, it's likley that some mods were missing a dependency on create and therefore weren't counted
