    <h1>(Curseforge) The state of create mods</h1>

    <h2>25% of downloads are attributed to just 5 mods</h2>
    <img src="./images/downloads_by_mod_pie.png" alt="Downloads by mod pie chart">

    <p>
        The 3 mods are: Crafts and Additions, Steam and Rails, Slice 'n' Dice. The other two are compat mods: Create Kube.JS, and Iris &amp; Oculus support.
    </p>

    <p>Here is a clearer list of a top section of mods:</p>
    <img src="./images/downloads_by_mod_bar.png" alt="Downloads by mod bar chart">

    <h2>25% of downloads are attributed to just 3 authors</h2>
    <img src="./images/downloads_by_author_pie.png" alt="Downloads by author pie chart">

    <p>
        The big 3: MRHminer (1 mod), possible_triangle (2 mods), IThundxr (3 mods).
    </p>

    <p>Top ~50 authors (total download count):</p>

    <p>I'm 44th :)</p>

    <h2>DragonsPlus is the number one modder by download performance!</h2>
    <p>
        Here is now the authors, but associated with their rates of download rather than accumulated downloads:
    </p>

    <p>
        Here again you can see there is actually quite a large gap between DragonsPlus and the next highest modder (IThundxr)

    <h3>Who the hell is robinfrt!?</h3>
    <p>No clue, but they own 16 (16!!) mods:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Create: Deep Dark [Forge/NeoForge]</li>
        <li>Create: Rustic Structures [Forge/Fabric/NeoForge]</li>
        <li>Create: Curios Jetpack &amp; Backtank [Forge/Fabric/NeoForge]</li>
        <li>Create: Cheese Factory [Forge/NeoForge]</li>
        <li>Create: Peaceful [Forge/Fabric/NeoForge]</li>
        <li>Create: Ranged [Forge/Fabric/NeoForge]</li>
        <li>Create: Simple Ore Doubling [Forge/Fabric/NeoForge]</li>
        <li>Create: Easy Stone Generators [Forge/Fabric/NeoForge]</li>
        <li>Create: Copper &amp; Zinc [Forge/Fabric/NeoForge]</li>
        <li>Create: Ultimate Factory [Datapack]</li>
        <li>Create: Copper &amp; Zinc [Datapack]</li>
        <li>Create: Enlightend [Forge/NeoForge]</li>
        <li>Create: Ultimate Factory [Forge/Fabric/NeoForge]</li>
        <li>Create: Ironworks [Forge/Fabric/NeoForge]</li>
        <li>Create: Crafts &amp; (More) Additions [Forge/Fabric]</li>
        <li>Create: Winery [Forge/NeoForge]</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Wow, what a guy!</p>

    <h2>Mods by download rates</h2>
    <img src="./images/download_rate_by_mod.png" alt="Download rate by mod">

    <p>
        Quite similar to the mods by total download counts, but it is a bit more even, also clearly shows Steam 'n' Rails and Crafts and Additions to be the 2 main downloaded mods.
    </p>

    <h2>Mods by download performance against their actual download counts</h2>
    <img src="./images/download_rate_against_downloads.png" alt="Download rate by author">

    <p>
        While there are many breakthroughs, few of the highest performing mods are new, which is to be expected since as the way I see it, the 'promotion loop' forms a significant portion of downloads for these mods (where more downloaded mods show up higher in listings and are in turn downloaded more), rather than just the contributions from modpack inclusions.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusions</h2>
    <p>
        I'm going to lock in and produce the coolest mod ever just you wait im going to be NUMBER ONE.
    </p>

    <h2>Biases</h2>
    <p>
        Because all of this data is sourced from Curseforge there are some important biases to note:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Mods that are included in modpacks are significantly more downloaded</li>
        <li>More technical mods (such as my own, pattern schematics) perform worse than more general mods (like trading floor) on modrinth rather than curseforge</li>
        <li>Some mods might be missing, of the massive sample I was able to collect, it's likely that some mods were missing a dependency on create and therefore weren't counted</li>
    </ul>
